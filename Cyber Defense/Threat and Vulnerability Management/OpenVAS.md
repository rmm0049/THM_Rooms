# OpenVAS 
#### Task 1 Introduction
OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner) is an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. It is commonly used by corporations as part of their mitigation solutions to quickly identify any gaps in their production or even development servers or applications.

### Task 2 GVM Framework Architecture
THe OpenVAS is built off the GreenBone Vulnerability Management (GVM) solution and is only one of the appliances that is released from GreenBone.

#### Vulnerability/Information Feed (NVT, SCAP, CERT, User Data, Community Feed)
Contains all information and vulnerability tests that come from the Greenbone Community Feed that will be the main baseline for testing against systems.

#### Back-End (OSP, OpenVAS, Targets)
The back-end infrastructure is waht will be actually conducting all of the vulnerability scanning and processing data and NVTS through OpenVAS and GVM. GVM will be the middle man between the scanners and the front-end user interfaces.

#### Front-End (GSA, Web Interfaces)
This is what you interact with when you navigate to OpenVAS in the browser. The web interfaces are built off of the Greenbone Security Assistant and make life easier for an analyst or operator when working with OpenVAS or other forms of scanners through the GVM.

### Task 3 Installing OpenVAS
OpenVAS can be installed from Kali/OpenVAS repos, install from source, or run from a docker container. For our purposes, the preferred method is to run it inside a docker container so we don't worry about setup or errors that we may run into with other installation methods

Option 3: Run from Docker (preferred)
1. `apt install docker.io`
2. `docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas`

Default credentials to the web interface

**Username**: `admin`
**Password**: `admin`

### Task 4 Initial Configuration
We need to do a little bit of setup and configuration to get OpenVAS properly working.

To test to see if things are working, *Scans -> Tasks* to set a scan of localhost (127.0.0.1) to test the installation.


### Task 7 Practical Vulnerability Management
Case 001: MS00-What?

In this scenario, you are assigned to a routine vulnerability management pipeline as a SOC analyst. Your automated pipeline has already pulled a scan on the server, it is up to you to analyze and identify risk in this report.

When did the scan start?
**Sun Feb 28 00:04:46 2021 UTC**

When did the scan end?
**Sun Feb 28 00:21:02 2021 UTC**

How many ports are open?
**4**

How many total vulnerabilities
**5 total**

What is the highest severity vulnerability found? (MSxx-xxx)
**MS17-010** **Microsoft Windows SMB Server multiple Vulnerabilities-Remote**

What is the first affected OS to this vulnerability?
**Microsoft Windows 10 x32/x64 Edition**

What is the recommended vulnerability detection method?
**Send the crafted SMB transaction request with fid = 0 and check the response to confirm the vulnerability.**
