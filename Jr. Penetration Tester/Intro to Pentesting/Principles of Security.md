# Principles of Security
### Introduction
The measures, frameworks, and protocols discussed throughout this room all play a small part in "Defense in Depth"

Defense in Depth is the use of multiple varied layers of security to an organization's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will provide redudancy in an organization's security perimeter.

### The CIA Triad
Stands for **C**onfidentiality **I**ntegrity **A**vailability, and has become an industry standard.

**Confidentiality**: Protetion of data from unauthorized access and misuse.
**Integrity**: Condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.
**Availability**: In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user. Is often a benchmark for an organization, for example having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems.

### Principles of Privileges
It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an IT system individuals require

Access is given to people based on:
- Their role/function within the organization
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM).

PIM is used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system. Whereas PAM is the management of the pivileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of least privilege. Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary for them to perform their duties. Other people should be able to trust what people write to.

### Task 4 Security Models Continued
##### Bell-La Padula Model
Used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organization's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyones responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".  Popular within organizations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organizations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting.

##### Biba Model
Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad. This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarized as "no write up, no read down".

The Biba model is used in organizations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job. They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc.

##### Threat Modelling & Incident Response
A critical stage of the threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to.

The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers.The principles all return to:
- Preparation
- Identification
- Mitigations
- Review

An effective threat model includes:
- Threat intelligence
- Asset identification
- Mitigation capabilities
- Risk assessment

**STRIDE** (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges) and **PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) infosec never tasted so good!

- Spoofing: Involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.
- Tampering: Providing anti-tampering measures to a system or aplication
- Repudiation: Principle dictates the use of services such as loggin of activity for a system or application to track.
- Information Disclosure: Handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to show only releveant info to the owner.
- Denial of Service: Things use of system resources, things should be in place so that this does not result in bringing down the whole system when abused.
- Elevation of Privilege: Worst-case scenario for an application or service. User was able to escalate their privilege to a higher level on system.

 Six phases of Incident Response by a **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**
 - Preparation: Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with security incident?
 - Identification: Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
 - Containment: Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
- Eradication: Remove the active threat.
- Recovery: Perform a full review of the impacted system to return to a business as usual operations.
- Lessons Learned: What can be learnt from the incident?
