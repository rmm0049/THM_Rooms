# Pentesting Fundamentals
### Task 1 What is Penetration Testing?
Finding vulnerabilities in a clients application or system. A penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

### Test 2 Penetration Testing Ethics
A penetration test is an **authorised audit** of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. The legality of penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised.

Before a test occurs, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. 

Pentesters will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data. Or they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organization's human security. If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal -- however ethically questionable.

Hackers are usually broken into three hats

- White Hat: Are considered "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
- Grey Hat: Use their skills to benefit other often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
- Black Hat: Are criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

##### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
A document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections, which ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document.

- Permission: gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out.
- Test Scope: Annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply.
- Rules: Exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.

### Task 3 Penetration Testing Methodologies
Tests can vary widely, so no test is the same. The steps a tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand.

- Information Gathering: OSINT and research
- Enumeration/Scanning: Discovering applications and services running on a system.
- Exploitation: Levaraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application
- Privilege Escalation: Escalate horizontally to another user or to the admin level
- Post-exploitation: This involves a few sub stages:
	- What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
	- What additional info can we gather from the host now that we are privileged
	- Covering your tracks
	- Reporting

##### OSSTMM
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

1. **Telecommunications** (Phones, VoIP, etc.)
2. Wired Networks
3. Wireless communications

##### OWASP
Open Web Application Security Project is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

##### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
A popular framework used to improve an organizations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honorable mention because of its popularity and detail.

##### NCSC CAF
The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organizations defences against these.

Mainly focuses on these:
- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

### Task 4 Black box, White box, Grey box
There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service, and your knowledge of the target will determine the level of testing that you will perform.

##### Black-Box testing
There is no knowledge known and you are completely in the unkown.

##### Grey-Box testing
Most popular, comes with some limited knowledge of the internal components.

##### White-Box testing
Usually performed by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. Will look at the internal components of the application or piece of software, and for example ensure that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time. **Full** knowledge on this one.
