### Task 2 Exploring the Website
Finding interactive portions of the website can be as easy as spotting a login form to manually reviewing the website's JavaScript. An excellent place to start is just with your browser exploring the website noting down the individual pages/areas/features with a summary for each one.

### Task 3 Viewing the Page Source
You can view the page source of the web page, the returned code is made up of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it's what tells the browser what to display.
