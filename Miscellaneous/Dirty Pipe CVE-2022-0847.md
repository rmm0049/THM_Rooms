### Intro
In March 2022, a researcher named Max Kellerman publicly disclosed a Linux Kernel vulnerability (nicknamed "Dirty Pipe" for its similarities to "Dirty Cow" exploit affecting older versions of the kernel) that allowed attackers to overwrite files on the OS.

Arbitrary file overwrites at the kernel level can be easily leveraged to escalate privileges on the machine.
